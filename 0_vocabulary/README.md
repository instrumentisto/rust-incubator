Step 0: Building Up an Vocabulary
========================================

__Estimated time__: 4 days

> ❗️ To meet the first deadline, please open a Pull Request by Sunday of  the first week and include answers to at least one question in it.

Read through [Rust Book], [Rust FAQ], and become familiar with basic [Rust] concepts, syntax, memory model, type and module systems.

Polish your familiarity by completing [Rust By Example] and [rustlings].

Read through [Cargo Book] and become familiar with [Cargo] and its workspaces.

After completing these steps, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What memory model [Rust] has? Is it single-threaded or multiple-threaded? Is it synchronous or asynchronous? What is the memory layout of the box and vector? What are heap and stack? Where, but on heap and stack data could live in RAM?
- What runtime [Rust] has? Does it use a GC (garbage collector)?
- What statically typing means? What is a benefit of using it? Weak typing vs strong typing? Implicit / explicit?
- What are generics and parametric polymorphism? Which problems do they solve?
- What is nominative typing and structural typing? What is difference?
- What are traits? How are they used? How do they compare to interfaces? What are an auto trait and a blanket impl? Uncovered type? What is a marker trait?
- What are static and dynamic dispatches? Which should I use, and when? What is monomorphisation?
- What is a crate, module and package in Rust? How do they differ? How are the used? What is workspace?
- What is cloning? What is copying? How do they compare? What is for trait drop? What is special about the trait?
- What is immutability? What is the benefit of using it? What is the difference between immutability and const?
- What are move semantics? What are borrowing rules? What is the benefit of using them?
- What is RAII? How is it implemented in [Rust]? What is the benefit of using it?
- What are lifetimes? Which problems do they solve? Which benefits do they give?
- What is an iterator? What is a collection? How do they differ? How are they used?
- What are macros? Which problems do they solve? What is the difference between declarative and procedural macro?
- How code is tested in [Rust]? Where should you put tests and why?
- What is special about slice? What is layout of Rust standard data types? Difference between fat and thin pointers?
- Why [Rust] has `&str` and `String` types? How do they differ? When should you use them? Why str slice coexist with slice? What is differnece between `String` and `Vec`?
- Is [Rust] OOP language? Is it possible to use SOLID/GRASP? Does it have an inheritance? Is Rust functional language? What variance rules does Rust have?

After you're done notify your lead in an appropriate PR (pull request), and he will exam what you have learned.
