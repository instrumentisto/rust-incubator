Step 1.2: Boxing and pinning
============================

__Estimated time__: 1 day




## Boxing

[`Box`] is a pointer that owns heap-allocated data. This is the most common and simplest form of [heap] allocation in [Rust].

It's more idiomatic to use references (`&T`/`&mut T`) for pointing to the data, however they often come with lifetime complexity. [`Box`] allows to avoid this complexity at the cost of heap allocation.

[`Box`] is also a way to go if an owned [slice] is needed, but is not intended to be resized. For example, `Box<str>`/`Box<[T]>` are often used instead of `String`/`Vec<T>` in such cases.

To better understand [`Box`]'s purpose, design, limitations, and use cases, read through:
- [Rust Book: 15.1. Using Box to Point to Data on the Heap][1]
- [Official `std::boxed` docs][`std::boxed`]
- [Amos: What's in the box?][3]
- [Mahdi Dibaiee: What is `Box<str>` and how is it different from `String` in Rust?][8]




## Pinning

It is sometimes useful to have objects that are guaranteed to not move, in the sense that their placement in memory does not change, and can thus be relied upon. A prime example of such a scenario would be building self-referential structs, since moving an object with pointers to itself would invalidate them, which could cause undefined behavior.

[`Pin<P>`][`Pin`] ensures that the pointee of any pointer type `P` has a stable location in memory, meaning it cannot be moved elsewhere and its memory cannot be deallocated until it gets dropped. We say that the pointee is "pinned".

However, many types are always freely movable, even when pinned, because they do not rely on having a stable address. This includes all the basic types (like `bool`, `i32`, references) as well as types consisting solely of these types. Types that do not care about pinning implement the [`Unpin`] marker trait, which cancels the effect of [`Pin`]. For `T: Unpin`, `Pin<Box<T>>` and `Box<T>` function identically, as do `Pin<&mut T>` and `&mut T`.

Note, that pinning and [`Unpin`] only affect the pointed-to type `P::Target`, not the pointer type `P` itself that got wrapped in `Pin<P>`. For example, whether or not `Box<T>` is `Unpin` has no effect on the behavior of `Pin<Box<T>>` (here, `T` is the pointed-to type).

## Task

1. For the following types: `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&[u8]`, `T`.  
   Implement the following traits:
   ```rust
   trait SayHi: fmt::Debug {
       fn say_hi(self: Pin<&Self>) {
           println!("Hi from {:?}", self)
       }
   }
   ```
   ```rust
   trait MutMeSomehow {
       fn mut_me_somehow(self: Pin<&mut Self>) {
           // Implementation must be meaningful, and
           // obviously call something requiring `&mut self`.
           // The point here is to practice dealing with
           // `Pin<&mut Self>` -> `&mut self` conversion
           // in different contexts, without introducing 
           // any `Unpin` trait bounds.
       }
   }
   ```

2. For the following structure:
   ```rust
   struct MeasurableFuture<Fut> {
       inner_future: Fut,
       started_at: Option<std::time::Instant>,
   }
   ```
   Provide a [`Future`] trait implementation, transparently polling the `inner_future`, and printing its execution time in nanoseconds once it's ready. Using `Fut: Unpin` trait bound (or similar) is not allowed. 




## Questions

After completing everything above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What does "boxing" mean in [Rust]? How is it useful? When and why is it required?
- What is [`Pin`] and why is it required? What guarantees does it provide? How does it fulfill them?
- How does [`Unpin`] affect the [`Pin`]? What does it mean?
- Is it allowed to move pinned data after the [`Pin`] dies? Why?
- What is structural pinning? When should it be used and why?
- What is [`Pin`] projection? Why does it exist? How is it used?
