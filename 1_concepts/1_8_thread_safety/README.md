Step 1.8: Thread safety
=======================

__Estimated time__: 1 day

[Rust] has [`Send`] and [`Sync`] marker traits which are fundamental for concurrency and thread safety story in [Rust] and represent one of [fearless concurrency][2] corner stones (which allow to [avoid data races][1] at compile time).

To better understand [`Send`]/[`Sync`]'s purpose, design, limitations and use cases, read through:
- [Official `Send` docs][`Send`]
- [Official `Sync` docs][`Sync`]
- [Rust Book: 16.4. Extensible Concurrency with the Sync and Send Traits][3]
- [Rustonomicon: 8.2. Send and Sync][4]
- [Huon Wilson: Some notes on Send and Sync][5]
- [Piotr Sarnacki: Arc and Mutex in Rust][9]
- [nyanpasu64: An unsafe tour of Rust's Send and Sync][6]
- [Josh Haberman: Thread Safety in C++ and Rust][7]
- [Cliff L. Biffle: Safely writing code that isn't thread-safe][8]
- [Louis Dureuil: Too dangerous for C++][10]

## Task

Implement the following types, which meet conditions:
1. `OnlySync` is `Sync`, but `!Send`.
2. `OnlySend` is `Send`, but `!Sync`.
3. `SyncAndSend` is both `Sync` and `Send`.
4. `NotSyncNotSend` is both `!Sync` and `!Send`.

All inner details of implementation are on your choice.

Play with these types from multiple threads to see how compile time [fearless concurrency][2] works in practice.




## Questions

After completing everything above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What does "fearless concurrency" mean in [Rust]? With which mechanisms does [Rust] fulfill this guarantee exactly?
- Why do [`Send`] and [`Sync`] exist at all? How is it related to interior mutability?
