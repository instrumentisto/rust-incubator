Step 4.1: Databases, connection pools and ORMs
==============================================

__Estimated time__: 1 day

The current situation with databases integration in [Rust] ecosystem is illustrated quite well in [this "Awesome Rust" section][1] and in ["Database" topic of "Are we web yet?"][2]: the majority of the drivers are implemented fully in [Rust], and only few wrap existing libraries, and of course, most of them use [async I/O][3].




## Connection pool

The important concept to understand is a [connection pool][11] pattern. It's widely adopted in situations where a program represents a long-running application (like [daemons][12] or [servers][13]). The key point is that __instead of creating a new connection to database every time__ we need to interact with, we'd __rather pre-create a [pool][14] of such connections and reuse them__. As connection creation is quite an expensive operation, applying this pattern leads to huge performance improvements.

Fortunately, [Rust] ecosystem provides generic implementations of database-agnostic [connection pool][1] in both flavours: synchronous and asynchronous.

To better understand [connection pooling][1], read through:
- [Charlie Custer: What is Connection Pooling, and Why Should You Care][15]


### Synchronous

For synchronous connections there is the [`r2d2`] crate (the pioneer among such crates, existed far before [async I/O][3] has landed in [Rust]). You can easily adopt it for your specific use-case (or database) just by implementing [its traits][22]. Obviously, there are [implementations for common drivers][21] already.

For more details, read through:
- [Official `r2d2` crate docs][`r2d2`]


### Asynchronous

For asynchronous connections there are much more options in [Rust] ecosystem, due to historical reasons and bigger competitiveness (as the result of bigger [async I/O][3] popularity).

The very first one, historically, was the [`bb8`] crate. It mirrors the [`r2d2`] crate for asynchronous connections ([`tokio`] only), and originally was based on it. Similarly, there are [implemented bridges for common drivers][23] already.

[`deadpool`] is an [alternative and very mature][25] implementation of the [connection pool][11] pattern, supporting both [`tokio`] and [`async-std`], provided with [its own large ecosystem][24].

Another alternative implementation is the [`mobc`] crate, yet inspired by [`deadpool`] and [`r2d2`] crates. Similarly, supports both [`tokio`] and [`async-std`] and provides some [bridges for common drivers][26].

[`qp`] (Quick Pool) is a very simple and [limited][29] implementation of the [connection pool][11] pattern, [utilizing lock-free primitives][27] and [focused on being performant][28].

For more details, read through:
- [Official `bb8` crate docs][`bb8`]
- [Official `deadpool` crate docs][`deadpool`]
- [Official `mobc` crate docs][`mobc`]
- [Official `qp` crate docs][`qp`]




## Query builder

Query builder is effectively a __[builder pattern][81] applied for building [SQL]__ (or other [data query languages][82]) queries, and __allowing to write them as a regular [Rust] code__ (and so, [using an embedded DSL instead of external DSL][83]).

The canonical implementation of this pattern in [Rust] ecosystem is represented by [`sea-query`] and [`sql_query_builder`] crates.

[`barrel`] crate, on the other hand, allows to write [schema migrations][61], rather than querying data.

For more details, read through:
- [Official `sea-query` crate docs][`sea-query`]
- [Official `sql_query_builder` crate docs][`sql_query_builder`]
- [Official `barrel` crate docs][`barrel`]


### Non-[DSL] toolkit

[`sqlx`] crate, while being a feature-rich toolkit for [SQL], takes a [completely opposite approach][91] here: it focuses on writing pure [SQL] queries (no custom [DSL], no [query building](#query-builder)), which are statically checked to be correct at compile-time.

To better understand [`sqlx`]'s design, concepts, usage and features, read through:
- [Official `sqlx` crate docs][`sqlx`]




## ORM

Regarding the [ORM pattern][41], there are [multiple][42] feature-rich and mature implementation in [Rust] ecosystem at the moment. Every one has its own unique design, advantages and disadvantages.

The very first [ORM][41] created in [Rust] was the [`diesel`] crate. Even now, it supports [only synchronous][43] connections (as was created before [async I/O][3] has landed in [Rust]). However, still may be used with asynchronous connections, thankfully to the [`diesel-async`] extension.

[`sea-orm`] (built on top of [`sea-query`]) is an alternative feature-rich and [mature][46] implementation of the [ORM] pattern in [Rust], focused on [dynamic querying to avoid complexity of static checks ("fighting the ORM")][47].

[`ormx`] is a lightweight extension of the [`sqlx`] crate, aimed to provide it with [ORM][41]-like features.

[`rustorm`] is a very simple and [SQL]-centered [ORM][41], focused on easing conversions of database types to their appropriate [Rust] types.

To better understand [ORMs'][41] design, concepts, usage and features, read through:
- [Official `diesel` crate docs][`diesel`]
- [Official `diesel` crate guides][44]
- [Official `sea-orm` crate docs][`sea-orm`]
- [Official `sea-orm` crate guides][45]
- [Official `ormx` crate docs][`ormx`]
- [Official `rustorm` crate docs][`rustorm`]




## Migrations

For [database migrations][61] there are [multiple tools][62] in [Rust] ecosystem.

For [`diesel`] users, the obvious choice is the [`diesel_migrations`] crate (which may be used directly via [`diesel_cli`]). Though, doesn't require the [`diesel`] itself to be used, and may be used as a fully separate tool.

For [`sqlx`] users, similarly, the [`sqlx-cli`] tool [provides migrations][64] out-of-the-box, while also may be used [directly in the application code][65].

[`refinery`] and [`migrant`] are another standalone [Rust] tools for [migrations][61], allowing both [CLI] and ["in-application-code"][66] usage. The interesting part about the [`refinery`] crate is that it also allows to write "in-application-code" [migrations][61] via the [`barrel`] schema migration builder.

To be familiar with [migrations][61] tools, their similarities and differences, read through:
- [Official `diesel_migrations` crate docs][`diesel_migrations`]
- [Official `diesel_cli` crate docs][`diesel_cli`]
- [Official `diesel` crate guides: Getting Started][63]
- [Official `sqlx` crate docs: Macro `sqlx::migrate`][65]
- [Official `refinery` crate docs][`refinery`]
- [Official `migrant` crate docs][`migrant`]




## Task

Create an [SQL] database ([PostgreSQL], [MySQL] or [SQLite], on your choice) consisting of the following tables:
- `users`: `id`, `name` and any other fields on your choice; 
- `roles`: [`slug`][201] as a primary key, `name` and `permissions` (the concrete format on your choice) fields;
- `users_roles`: `users.id` to `roles.slug` many-to-many relationship.

Write a simple [CLI] application which allows to [CRUD] data in your database tables in the following ways:
- create and delete `users` and `roles` (a `user` must always have an assigned `role`);
- update fields of a single `user` or a `role`;
- assign or unassign a `role` to/from a `user`;
- list all `roles` or a single `role` by its `slug`;
- list all `users` or a single `user` by its `id` (a `user` should be displayed with all the `roles` assigned to him).

Consider to ensure [data consistency][202] in your database as much as possible.
