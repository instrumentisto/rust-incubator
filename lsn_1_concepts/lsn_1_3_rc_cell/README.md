Step 1.3: Shared ownership and interior mutability
==================================================

__Estimated time__: 1 day




## Shared ownership

[Rust] ownership model allows _only one owner of a value_. However, there are situations when multiple ownership is required, and it's important to understand how this can be accomplished.

The key piece is to put a value behind a smart pointer, so the pointer itself can be __cloned many times__ (thus allowing multiple owners), but is __pointing always to the same value__ (thus sharing a value). In [Rust] there is a [`Rc`] (["reference counted"][`std::rc`]) smart pointer for this purpose, and [`Arc`] ("atomic reference counted") for use in multiple threads. Both automatically destroy a value once there are no references left.

The code below won't compile as `a` is owned by `x` and moved to a heap before is passed to `y`:
```rust
struct Val(u8);

let a = Val(5);
let x = Box::new(a);
let y = Box::new(a);
```
```rust
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`
 --> src/main.rs:6:22
  |
5 |     let x = Box::new(a);
  |                      - value moved here
6 |     let y = Box::new(a);
  |                      ^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `a` has type `Val`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
```

However, [`Rc`] allows that:
```rust
let a = Rc::new(Val(5));
let x = Rc::clone(&a);  // does not clone original value,
let y = Rc::clone(&a);  // but rather produces new reference to it
```

The [`Rc`], however, __should be used wisely__ as __won't deallocate memory on references cycle__ which is exactly what a __memory leak__ is. [Rust] is unable to prevent memory leaks at compile time (though makes hard to produce them). If it's still required to have a references cycle, you should use a [`Weak`] smart pointer ("weak reference") in combination with [`Rc`]. [`Weak`] allows to break a references cycle as can refer to a value that has been dropped already (returns `None` in such case). 

For better understanding [`Rc`]/[`Weak`] purpose, design, limitations and use cases read through:
- [Rust Book: 15.4. Rc, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer][1]
- [Rust Book: 15.6. Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory][2]
- [Official `std::rc` docs][`std::rc`]




## Interior mutability

[Rust] memory safety is based on the following rules (known as "borrowing rules"):

> Given an object `T`, it is only possible to have one of the following:
> - Having several immutable references (`&T`) to the object (also known as __aliasing__).
> - Having one mutable reference (`&mut T`) to the object (also known as __mutability__).

However, quite often there are situations where these rules are not flexible enough and it's required to have multiple references to a value and yet mutate it. [`Cell`] and [`RefCell`] __encapsulate mutability inside__ (thus called "interior mutability") and __provide interface which can be used through common shared references__ (`&T`). [`Mutex`] and [`RwLock`] serve the same purpose, but in a multi-threaded context.

These containers __allow to overcome [Rust] borrowing rules and track borrows at runtime__ (so called "dynamic borrowing"), which, obviously, leads to less safe code as compile-time errors become runtime panics. That's why one should __use [`Cell`]/[`RefCell`] wisely and only as a last resort__.

For better understanding [`Cell`]/[`RefCell`] purpose, design, limitations and use cases read through:
- [Rust Book: 15.5. RefCell and the Interior Mutability Pattern][3]
- [Official `std::cell` docs][`std::cell`]
- [Paul Dicker: Interior mutability patterns][6]




## Shared mutability

The most spread case is a combination of two previous: `Rc<RefCell<T>>` (or `Arc<Mutex<T>>`). This allows to mutate a value by multiple owners.

A real-world example would be a database client object: it _must be mutable_, as mutates its state under-the-hood (opens network connections, manages database sessions, etc), yet _we need to own it in multiple places_ of our code, not a single one.

The following articles may explain you this concept better:
- [Manish Goregaokar: Wrapper Types in Rust: Choosing Your Guarantees][4]
- [Alexandre Beslic: Rust, Builder Pattern, Trait Objects, `Box<T>` and `Rc<T>`][5]




## Avoiding panics and deadlocks

There is a simple rule for omitting deadlocks with [`Mutex`]/[`RwLock`] (applicable for panics with [`Cell`]/[`RefCell`] types too):

> Locking scopes must not intersect in any way.

The following example explains why deadlocks happen:
```rust
let owner1 = Arc::new(Mutex::new("string"));
let owner2 = owner1.clone();

let value = owner1.lock.unwrap();

// owner2 locking scope intersects with owner1 lock's scope.
let value = owner2.lock.unwrap(); 
```

Let's remove the intersection:
```rust
let owner1 = Arc::new(Mutex::new("string"));
let owner2 = owner1.clone();
{
    let value = owner1.lock.unwrap();
    // No intersection as owner1 locking scope ends here.
}
{
    let value = owner2.lock.unwrap();
}
```

That's why, usually, you should __omit to expose `Rc<RefCell<T>>`__ (or `Arc<Mutex<T>>`) __in API__'s, but rather __make them an inner implementation detail__. Doing this way you have full control over all locking scopes inside your methods (no scope can expand to outside), so __ensure that no intersection will happen__, and __expose a totally safe API__.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct SharedString(Arc<Mutex<String>>);

impl SharedString {
    fn mutate_somehow(&self) {
        let mut val = self.lock.unwrap();
        *val = "another string"
    }
}

let owner1 = SharedString(Arc::new(Mutex::new("string")));
let owner2 = owner1.clone();

// We are mutating the same value here,
// but no locking scopes intersection may happen by design.
// Such API will never deadlock or panic 
// due to runtime violation of borrowing rules.
owner1.mutate_somehow();
owner2.mutate_somehow();
```




## Task

Write a `GlobalStack<T>` collection which represents a trivial unsized [stack] (may grow infinitely) and has the following semantics:
- can be mutated through multiple shared references (`&GlobalStack<T>`);
- cloning doesn't clone data, but only produces a pointer, so multiple owners mutate the same data.
