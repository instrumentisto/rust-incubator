Rust Incubator
==============

> It wasnâ€™t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about _empowerment_: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.

This project represents a hard-way step-by-step [Rust] learning course from language basics to a capability of web backend development.




## Prerequisites


### Toolchain

- [rustup] for installing [Rust] toolchain and keeping it up-to-date.
- [CLion]/[IntelliJ IDEA] + [IntelliJ Rust] + [Toml][IntelliJ Toml] plugins as development environment (or any other on your choice).


### Bookshelf

- [Rust Book] teaches and explains [Rust] basics.
- [Rust By Example] teaches you [Rust] basics using editable examples.
- [Rust Reference] is not a formal spec, but is more detailed and comprehensive than the [Rust Book].
- [Cheats.rs] and [Rust SVG Cheatsheet] for quick reference.
- [Rust Edition Guide] for considering improvements of [Rust 2018].
- [Rust std lib] documentation.
- [Cargo Book] is a guide to [Cargo], [Rust]'s build tool and dependency manager.
- [Rustdoc Book] is a guide to `rustdoc` documentation tool.
- [Rust Cookbook] is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks, using the crates of the [Rust] ecosystem.
- [Rust Design Patterns] is an open source repository of [Rust] design patterns and idioms.
- [Rust API Guidelines] is a set of recommendations on how to design and present APIs for [Rust].
- [Rust FAQ] answers common question about [Rust].
- [Rust Playground] allows to share and check runnable [Rust] code snippets online.
- [Awesome Rust] is a curated list of [Rust] code and resources.
- [This Week in Rust] represents handpicked and subscribable [Rust] weekly updates.
- [Baby Steps] blog of [Nicholas Matsakis](https://github.com/nikomatsakis) shares useful [Rust] patterns, ideas and design decisions.




## Steps


### Before you start

1. [Create][1] a new [GitHub repository] for yourself using this one [as template][2].
2. [Invite as a collaborator][3] of your repository the person you want to review your lessons (lead).


### Schedule

Each step must be performed as a separate [PR (pull request)][PR] with an appropriate name and checked here in README's schedule after completion. Each step is a [Cargo workspace member][4], so you can run/test it from a project root (i.e. `cargo run -p step_1_8`). Consider to use [rustfmt] and [Clippy] when you're writing [Rust] code.

Each step has estimated time for being completed. If any deeper investigation on step's theme is required for you, then it's on your own.

Do not hesitate to ask your lead with questions, however you won't receive a concrete answer, but rather a direction for investigation. _Lead is the one who asks questions about everything here and demands a concrete answers_.
