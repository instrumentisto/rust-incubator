Rust Incubator
==============

> It wasnâ€™t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about _empowerment_: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.
_<div align="right">Rust Book's Foreword</div>_

This project represents a hard-way step-by-step [Rust] learning course from language basics to a capability of web backend development.




## Prerequisites


### Toolchain

- [rustup] for installing [Rust] toolchain and keeping it up-to-date.
- [CLion]/[IntelliJ IDEA] + [IntelliJ Rust] + [Toml][IntelliJ Toml] plugins as development environment (or any other on your choice).


### Bookshelf

- [Rust Book] teaches and explains [Rust] basics.
- [Rust By Example] teaches you [Rust] basics using editable examples.
- [Rust Reference] is not a formal spec, but is more detailed and comprehensive than the [Rust Book].
- [Cheats.rs] and [Rust SVG Cheatsheet] for quick reference.
- [Rust Edition Guide] for considering improvements of [Rust 2018] and [Rust 2021].
- [Rust std lib] documentation.
- [Cargo Book] is a guide to [Cargo], [Rust]'s build tool and dependency manager.
- [Rustdoc Book] is a guide to `rustdoc` documentation tool.
- [Rust Cookbook] is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks, using the crates of the [Rust] ecosystem.
- [Rust Design Patterns] is an open source repository of [Rust] design patterns and idioms.
- [Effective Rust] is a collection of guidelines that had been learned from real world experience of creating software in [Rust].
- [Rust API Guidelines] is a set of recommendations on how to design and present APIs for [Rust].
- [Rust FAQ] answers common question about [Rust].
- [Rust Playground] allows to share and check runnable [Rust] code snippets online.
- [Awesome Rust] is a curated list of [Rust] code and resources.
- [This Week in Rust] represents handpicked and subscribable [Rust] weekly updates.
- [Baby Steps] blog of [Nicholas Matsakis](https://github.com/nikomatsakis) shares useful [Rust] patterns, ideas and design decisions.




## Steps


### Before you start

1. [Create][1] a new [GitHub repository] for yourself using this one [as template][11].
2. [Invite as a collaborator][12] of your repository the person you want to review your lessons (mentor or lead).

> __NOTE__: __This learning course is constantly improving and evolving over time.__ 
>
> To be up-to-date with the recent changes in your own copy of this repository, attach the upstream history with the following commands:
> ```bash
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/instrumentisto/rust-incubator.git
> git fetch upstream main
> git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories
> ```
> And then, whenever you want to grab some new changes, do the following:
> ```bash
> git fetch upstream main
> git merge upstream/main
> ```
> Additionally, to be aware about new changes, you may either [watch this repository on GitHub][2], or even track it via [RSS subscription].


### Schedule

Each step must be performed as a separate [PR (pull request)][PR] with an appropriate name and checkmarked here in README's schedule after completion. Each step is a [Cargo workspace member][13], so you can run/test it from the project root (i.e. `cargo run -p step_1_8`). __Consider to use [rustfmt] and [Clippy] when you're writing [Rust] code.__

Each step has the estimated time for completion. If any deeper investigation on step's theme is needed by you, then it's on your own.

Do not hesitate to ask your mentor/lead with questions, however you won't receive any concrete answer, but rather a direction for your own investigation. _Mentor/Lead is the one who asks questions here, demanding concrete and complete answers._
