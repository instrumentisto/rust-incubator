Step 3.3: Date and time
=======================

__Estimated time__: 1 day

[Rust] has a simple [`std::time`] module which contains very basic primitives for time measurements. To operate with dates, time zones, epochs, and other related stuff, the [`time`] and [`chrono`] crates are used in [Rust] ecosystem.

The main difference between them (except the API, ergonomics and maintaining activity) is that [`chrono`] crate parametrizes time zone in types, while [`time`] crate handles it in runtime. In practice, we recommend to use [`time`] crate (unless [`chrono`] better suits your needs), as it's much actively maintained and evolved.

If you hit limitations of [`time`] and [`chrono`] crates regarding their accuracy (like swallowing [leap seconds][3]) or supported formats/standards (like [TAI]), consider using the [`hifitime`] crate, representing a scientifically accurate and [formally verified][4] date and time library.

To better understand and be familiar with this topic, read through:
- [Official `std::time` docs][`std::time`]
- [Official `time` crate docs][`time`]
- [Official `chrono` crate docs][`chrono`]
- [Official `hifitime` crate docs][`hifitime`]




## Duration measurements for code

Beware, that to measure duration of some operation, you should not use [`time`] crate primitives or an [`std::time::SystemTime`], but only an [`std::time::Instant`] instead, as it provides [monotonic clock][1] measurement (otherwise, your time measurement may be inconsistent due to [system clock drift][2]).




## Task

Provide implementations for `User::age()` and `User::is_adult()` methods in [this step's crate](src/main.rs).

Prove your implementation correctness with additional tests. For tests reproducibility consider that "now time" is the date specified in the `NOW` constant.




## Questions

After completing everything above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- How does system clock and monotonic clock differ? What are use-cases for both?
- Why is system clock is not reliable for measuring duration? What causes its drift?
- What is the main practical difference between [`chrono`] and [`time`] crates?
- When [`hifitime`] crate could be useful?
