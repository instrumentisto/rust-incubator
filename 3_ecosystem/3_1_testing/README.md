Step 3.1: Testing and mocking
=============================

__Estimated time__: 1 day

[Rust] testing ecosystem [is not huge, but has grown quite well][1], providing some interesting libraries and solutions.




## Built-in testing capabilities

[Rust] provides quite good built-in testing capabilities, which are very well described in the following articles:
- [Rust Book: 11. Writing Automated Tests][2]
- [Rust By Example: 21. Testing][3]
- [Rust By Example: 12.3. Tests][4]




## BDD style

[BDD (behavior-driven development)][BDD] testing style implies that _test cases represent a program specification_, while _tests themselves prove the specification correctness_.

While [Rust] ecosystem has [some BDD testing style crates][11] (the most mature one is [`cucumber`] crate), it's not a requirement to use them to follow the [BDD] style (as they may be too complex for some trivial cases, like [unit testing][12]). There is nothing preventing you from following [BDD] style in usual [Rust] tests. So, instead of:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_hash() {
        let h = hash("some_string");
        
        assert_eq!(h.len(), 64);
        assert!(!h.contains("z"));
    }
}
```
You're always free to write it more meaningfully:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod hash_spec {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn has_64_symbols_len() {
        assert_eq!(hash("some_string").len(), 64);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn contains_hex_chars_only() {
        assert!(!hash("some_string").contains("z"));
    }
}
```
This makes tests more granular (and so, more meaningful test failures) and testing intentions become more understandable for readers.




## Mocking

[Rust] ecosystem has [enough solutions][1] for [mocking][41], some of them are quite mature.

The most interested one is [`mockiato`] crate at the moment, as is quite ergonomic in use and supports stable [Rust]. [`unimock`] crate works in the very similar way, but supports supertraits, as uses the single `Unimock` type for mocking. [`faux`] and [`mry`] crates are focused on struct mocking (instead of traits).

Additionally, [`mockito`] and [`wiremock`] crates should be mentioned as a quite useful one for HTTP testing.

The most powerful, however, is [`mockall`] crate. See [this overview][43] for more details.

To better understand and be familiar with [mocking][41] in [Rust], read through:
- [Alan Somers: Rust Mock Shootout!][43]
- [Oduah Chigozie: Mocking in Rust: Mockall and alternatives][45]
- [Official `mockall` crate docs][`mockall`]
- [Official `mockiato` crate docs][`mockiato`]
- [Official `unimock` crate docs][`unimock`]
- [Audun Halland: How to write a type-level mock library in Rust][44]




## Property testing

[Property testing][21] is another testing paradigm for considering. In a nutshell, it can be explained in the following way:

> _Property testing_ is a system of testing code by checking that certain properties of its output or behaviour are fulfilled for all inputs. These inputs are generated automatically, and, critically, when a failing input is found, the input is automatically reduced to a _minimal_ test case.

[Rust] ecosystem has quite good [`proptest`] and [`quickcheck`] crates, which provide tools and primitives for [property testing][21].

To better understand and be familiar with [property testing][21] in [Rust], read through:
- [`proptest` crate description][`proptest`]
- [`quickcheck` crate description][`quickcheck`]
- [Proptest Book][22]




## Fuzzing

[Fuzzing][31] is another testing technique, which involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program. It [really helps][32] to spot program crashes and memory leaks in edge cases.

[Rust] ecosystem has [several tools][33] for [fuzzing][31] at the moment. Most known are:
- [`cargo-fuzz`] is a command-line wrapper for using [`libFuzzer`].
- [afl.rs] allows to run [AFL (american fuzzy lop)][AFL] on code written in [Rust].
- [`honggfuzz`] is a security oriented fuzzer with powerful analysis options, which supports evolutionary, feedback-driven fuzzing based on code coverage (software- and hardware-based).

To better understand and be familiar with [fuzzing][31] in [Rust], read through:
- [Rust Fuzz Book][34]
- [Official `cargo-fuzz` crate docs][`cargo-fuzz`]
- [Official `honggfuzz` crate docs][`honggfuzz`]
- [Adrian Taylor: Comparative fuzzing parallel Rust tools][35]

## Task

For the implementation of a small [guessing game][51] in [this step's crate](src/main.rs) provide all possible tests you're able to write.




## Questions

After completing everything above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
- What is TDD style? What is BDD style? Where is the essential accent of BDD?
- What is mocking? When is it useful?
- What is property testing? How does it achieve its goals?
- What is fuzzing? How does it differ from property testing?
