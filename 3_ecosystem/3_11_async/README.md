Step 3.11: Async I/O, futures and actors
========================================

__Estimated time__: 2 days

While [threads](../3_10_threads) represent a solution for [CPU-bound] problems, for [I/O-bound] problems, traditionally, the solution is [async (non-blocking) I/O][1].

As of now, [Rust] has no async primitives in its standard library yet, so "by default" `std` I/O works in a synchronous manner (blocks the current [thread][33]). However, it provides [core abstractions][`std::future`] for building ones, using which, ecosystem crates (like [`tokio`]) implement and provide primitives for [async I/O][1].

It's important to note, that async story in [Rust] is [still][2] [maturing][3]. That's why things could be [quite cumbersome][5] at the moment, often [causing frustration][6] (especially, when it [comes to abstractions][7]). [wg-async][4] (async working group) works on making this easier, simpler, more ergonomic and powerful in the future.




## `Future`

The basic primitive of async story in [Rust] is a [future abstraction][8] (also often called "promise" in some other programming languages). There are two major concepts which differ [Rust implementation of futures][9] from other programming languages:
1. Futures are [poll-based][10] rather than push-based. This means that after creation, a future is not going to be executed automatically in-place, but rather should be explicitly executed by some executor (runtime/event-loop for futures). __Future does nothing unless polled__, so generally represents a [lazy computation][12].
2. Futures are [zero cost][11]. This means that the code written on futures compiles down to something equivalent (or better than) a “hand-rolled” implementation, which would typically use manual state machines and careful memory management.

[Rust] provides only basic trait definitions in the [`std::future`] module of its standard library. To use futures with all its power, consider to use the [`futures`] crate (and/or similar ones like [`futures-lite`], [`futures-time`], etc).

To understand [Rust] futures concepts and design better, read through:
- [Aaron Turon: Zero-cost futures in Rust][11]
- [Aaron Turon: Designing futures for Rust][9]
- [Rust RFC 2592: `futures_api`][13]
- [Asynchronous Programming in Rust: 2.1. The `Future` Trait][20]
- [Conrad Ludgate: Let's talk about this async][14]

It's important to mention, that before [futures design has been stabilized][13], for quite a long period of time [Rust] ecosystem used [`futures@0.1`] crate, which resulted in a big part of ecosystem being built on top of them. Hopefully, as for now, only quite few outdated or dead crates still do use [`futures@0.1`], and, fortunately, they still can be used simultaneously with the modern [`std::future`]-based ecosystem by using the [compatibility layer][15].


### `async`/`.await`

[`async`/`.await` keywords][16] make async programming much more intuitive, ergonomic, and [solves numerous problems with types and borrows][19] (which may be quite tricky when using raw [`futures`]).

> Use `async` in front of `fn`, `closure`, or a `block` to turn the marked code into a `Future`. As such the code will not be run immediately, but will only be evaluated when the returned `Future` is `.await`ed.

[Rust] automatically [desugars `async` functions and blocks into the ones returning a `Future`][17], applying the correct [lifetime capturing and elision rules][18] for the syntax ergonomics.

Though, [`async` keyword in not supported in trait methods yet][2], there is the [`async-trait`] crate, which allows this for traits by desugaring into a [`Box`]ed [`Future`] (the main downside of which is being non-transparent over auto-traits like `Send`/`Sync`). 

To better understand `async`/`.await` keywords design, desugaring, usage and features, read through:
- [Rust RFC 2394: `async_await`][16]
- [Asynchronous Programming in Rust: 3. `async`/`.await`][21]
- [Hayden Stainsby: how I finally understood async/await in Rust (part 1)][63]
- [David Tolnay: Await a minute, why bother?][19]
- [Arpad Borsos: Implementation Details of async Rust][27]
- [Tyler Madry: How Rust optimizes async/await I][29]
- [Tyler Madry: How Rust optimizes async/await II: Program analysis][30]


### Tasks and `Waker`

Except the [future abstraction][8] itself, it's important to understand what is an [asynchronous task][22]:
> Each time a future is polled, it is polled as part of a "task". Tasks are the top-level futures that have been submitted to an executor.

When a task is suspended due to waiting some non-blocking operation to complete (it's used to call it "parked"), there should be a way to signal an executor to continue polling this task once the operation finishes. The [`Waker`] (being provided in the [`task::Context`]) serves exactly this purpose:
> `Waker` provides a `wake()` method that can be used to tell the executor that the associated task should be awoken. When `wake()` is called, the executor knows that the task associated with the `Waker` is ready to make progress, and its future should be polled again.

To better understand [`Waker`]'s design, usage and features, read through:

- [Asynchronous Programming in Rust: 2.2. Task Wakeups with `Waker`][22]

## Async I/O

Async I/O in [Rust] is possible due to two main ingredients: __[non-blocking I/O operations][1]__ provided by operating system and an __asynchronous runtime__, which wraps those operations into usable asynchronous abstractions and provides an [event loop][48] for executing and driving them to completion.


### Non-blocking I/O

The async programming is not possible without support for [non-blocking I/O][1], which is represented by various [API]s on different operating systems, for example: [epoll] on [Linux] (or promising [io_uring]), [kqueue] on [macOS]/[iOS], [IOCP] on [Windows].

The low-level crates, like [`mio`] (powering [`tokio`]) and [`polling`] (powering [`async-std`]), provide a single multi-platform unified interface to the majority of those [API]s. There are also low-level crates, specialized on a concrete [API], like [`io-uring`].

To better understand this topic, read through:
- [Official `mio` crate docs][`mio`]
- [Official `polling` crate docs][`polling`]


### Runtime

The high-level crates, like [`tokio`] (pioneer and most mature, by far) and [`async-std`] (not to be confused by its name, it's neither official, nor `std`-related, just a name chosen by authors), provide not only an [executor implementation][32] for executing [`Future`]s, but also high-level [API]s for [non-blocking I/O][1], [timers][`tokio::time`], and [synchronization primitives][`tokio::sync`] for use in asynchronous contexts ([usual synchronization primitives cannot be used across `.await` points][34] as they will block the whole executor in its current [thread][33]).

All [Rust] asynchronous runtimes for [`Future`]s implement the idea of [cooperative multitasking][35], meaning that the tasks ([`Future`]s in our case) yield control back to their runtime voluntarily (on `.await` points in our case), in contrast with [preemptive multitasking][36] where the runtime can suspend and take control back whenever it decides to (like in [OS threads][33] or [Erlang VM][37]). This gives the benefit of precise control on what is executed and how, but has the disadvantage of requiring to take great care about how [asynchronous tasks][22] are organized (like [avoiding blocking][39] them with synchronous or [CPU-bound] operations and [yielding manually][38] in busy loops).

Also, important to classify [Rust] asynchronous runtimes in the following manner:
- __Single-thread__ runtimes, __scheduling and executing [`Future`]s only on the current [thread][33]__ they're run on.  
  _Examples: [`tokio`'s current-thread scheduler][40], [`tokio-uring`], [`futures::executor::LocalPool`]._
- __Multi-thread__ runtimes, scheduling and executing [`Future`]s on a [thread pool][41]:
    - With __[work-stealing][42]__, where [`Future`]s are __both scheduled and executed on different [threads][33]__, so one [thread][33] can [steal and execute `Future`s initally scheduled on another thread][43], and as the result, workload is distributed more evenly in cost of synchronization overhead ([`Future`]s are required to be [`Send`]).  
      _Examples: [`tokio`'s multi-thread scheduler][44], [`async-executor`] of [`async-std`], [`futures::executor::ThreadPool`]._
    - Using __[thread-per-core][45]__ model, where [`Future`]s are __scheduled on different [threads][33], but never leave their [thread][33] until executed completely__, and so, avoid any synchronization overhead ([`Future`]s are not required to be [`Send`]).  
      _Examples: [`actix-rt`] built on top of multiple [`tokio`'s current-thread schedulers][40], [`glommio`]._

Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no meaningful way to abstract over multiple asynchronous runtimes in [Rust]. That's why authors of the libraries using [non-blocking I/O][1] either stick with a single concrete runtime only ([`tokio`], mostly), or support multiple runtimes via [Cargo features][46].

- [Official `tokio` crate docs][`tokio`]
- [Official `async-std` crate docs][`async-std`]

## Actors

[Actor model][49] is another very spread and famous [concurrency programming paradigm][50]. It fits quite good for solving major concurrent communication problems, so many languages adopted it as their main [concurrency paradigm][50] (the most famous implementations are [Akka][51] and [Erlang][52]).

> [Actor model][53] was put forth by [Carl Hewitt] in 1973 and it adopts the philosophy that everything is an actor. This is similar to the everything is an object philosophy used by some object-oriented programming languages.
>
> It is inherently asynchronous, a message sender will not block whether the reader is ready to pull from the mailbox or not, instead the message goes into a queue usually called a "mailbox". Which is convenient, but it's a bit harder to reason about and mailboxes potentially have to hold a lot of messages.
>
> Each process has a single mailbox, messages are put into the receiver's mailbox by the sender, and fetched by the receiver.

It's somewhat very similar to and interchangeable with [Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model][54], as operates on the same level of abstractions, but the main [difference][55] can be described like this:
> [Actors model][49] represents identifiable processes (actors) with non-identifiable communication (message delivery), while [CSP model][54] represents non-identifiable processes with identifiable communication (channels). To deliver a message in [actors model][49] we should "name" the actor, while in [CSP model][54] we should "name" the channel.

In [Rust], [actor abstraction][49] is __mainly useful for expressing some long-living state__ to communicate with (like [background worker][56] or [WebSocket connection][57], for example).

The most famous [actors][49] implementation in [Rust] is [`actix`]. At the time it was designed, it also served as __a "glue" to unite sync and async worlds__, providing both sync and async [actors][49] implementations. Nowadays, however, using [`spawn_blocking()`][39] is usually a more convenient alternative for this.

[`quickwit-actors`] is another simple implementation of [actors][49], with its own advantages, built [specifically for Quickwit needs][62].

More general-purpose and complex [actors system][49] implementations (similar to [Akka]) are [`bastion`], [`riker`] and [`hydra`].

To better understand [actors'][49] design, concepts, usage and implementations, read through:

- [Official `actix` crate docs][`actix`]
- [Official `actix` user guide][58]

## Task

Implement an async-driven [CLI] tool, which downloads specified web pages:
```bash
cargo run -p step_3_11 -- [--max-threads=<number>] <file>
```
It must read a list of links from the `<file>`, and then concurrently download a content of each link into a separate `.html` file (named by a link).

`--max-threads` argument must control the maximum number of _simultaneously running threads_ in the program (should default to CPUs number).
