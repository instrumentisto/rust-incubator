# Chapter 6: Capstone project

Congratulation! You've almost done it!

Create a portfolio project using Rust within a **3-day** timeframe. The project should showcase your proficiency in Rust, demonstrate your coding style, and highlight your problem-solving skills. The goal is to create a functional project that can be presented to potential employers or shared with the programming community.

Good project, it is project, that:

-   You can add to your portfolio / resume;
-   Falls within the scope of the specialization.
-   Has a clearly defined main objective.

### This project should be open-source.

> ❗️ Please create a new **public repository** (in the personal namespace) for your capstone project.

> ❗️ Open a PR in your **public repository** to the master/main branch so that mentors can leave feedback on your project.

## Task 6.1: Agree on your capstone project

Choose a project idea that is suitable for implementation within a **3-day** timeframe. Consider the complexity and feasibility of the project.

Consider this project as an opportunity to learn and grow your skills in Rust. Challenge yourself by exploring new Rust features, libraries, or patterns, and incorporate them into your project where appropriate.

If you're having trouble finding a suitable subject for your project, don't hesitate to ask your mentors for suggestions.

To get approval of the subject of the project from a mentor, you must fulfill the following requirements:

-   Provide a clear description of the project's main objective.
-   Ensure that the main objective can be realistically implemented within a **3-day** timeframe.
-   Include a description of what the project will do and what it will not do.

> ❗️ You have to approve the subject of the project with your mentor.

## Task 6.2: Get approvement of basic implementation from the first mentor

Focus on designing and developing a minimum viable version of your project, rather than a fully finished product, given the limited time frame. Don't worry about achieving perfection in your implementation at this stage. Just ensure you get your mentor's approval on your work.

> ❗️ Any one mentor from **your group** should review your project and approve it.

## Task 6.3: Get 4 reviews from peers and mentors

Teamwork is crucial in our program, as is respecting senior team members and acknowledging the strengths of your peers. You are required to obtain four reviews of your work from your peers and mentors. These reviews should incorporate diverse perspectives: at least one should be from a peer and at least one from a mentor outside your immediate group. You're encouraged to consider and apply the majority of the feedback you receive in these reviews.

You are required to obtain approval from (at least 1 per category):

-   Rust forum
    -   https://users.rust-lang.org/c/code-review/11
    -   Create a new topic in the "Code Review" category. And ask for a review of your project.
-   Mentor from the current bootcamp (outside your immediate group)
-   Mentor from the current bootcamp (inside your immediate group)
-   Student from the current bootcamp (from any group)

### You need to collect proof of these reviews. And sent it as Pull Request in your private repository in the bootcamp organization:

1. Collect proofs of these reviews as a screenshots + links to the comments.
2. Come back your private repository in the bootcamp organization (where you did previous tasks).
3. Send proofs same way as in the previous tasks. With usage of the current task as a name.
4. Then, process is the same as in the previous tasks.

> ❗️You do not need to copy your project code to the bootcamp repository.

## Task 6.4: Present your project

In a successful team, members feel comfortable being vulnerable and open to feedback. As such, you are expected to present your project to your peers and mentors. This will allow you to receive more feedback, further facilitating your growth and learning.

Congrats! At this stage, you already have a minimum portfolio.
